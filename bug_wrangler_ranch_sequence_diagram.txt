main->drovers: May I please have the specific drovers for this journey?
drovers->database: May I please have all the drovers
database->drovers: Here are all the drovers
loop 
drovers->drovers: Iterate through the drovers array\nx times where x is the number of\ndrovers needed proportional to\nthe amount of cattle.
note over drovers: Each iteration will randomize a number between\n1 and the total number of drovers to send me a\nrandom ID that corresponds to a drover. Then\n push that drover object to an array based on the drover's ID.
end
drovers->main: Here are the drovers for the journey!

main->cattle: May I please have the cattle types for each cattle in the journey?
cattle->database: May I please have all the cattle types?
database->cattle: Here is an array of all the cattle types!
loop 
cattle->cattle: Iterate x times where\nx is the number of cattle on the journey
note over cattle: Randomize a number between 1 and\nthe total types of cattle (4), extract an\nobject(which represents an individual cattle) ,\nwhose id matches the randomized number,\nfrom the cattleType array and push that object\nto an empty array
end
cattle->main: Here is an array of cattleType objects, which represent the individual cattle that will make the journey.

main->journey: May I please have the path that the journey will take?


note over journey: createRivers function creates a\nrandom floating point between 0 and 1,\nmultiplies it by an integer(3),\nrounds down to the nearest integer\nand then adds by 1 to return a value\nbetween 1 and 4 to represent the number of rivers.
note over journey: The same process is used\nto determine the number of\nmountains, forests, and\nplains in the journey. These\nfunctions are invoked and\nthe return values (integers\nrepresenting number of rivers,\netc.) stored as the values in an object.
loop 
journey->journey: iterate through the number of rivers,\nforests, etc. and push a string ('plain') to an array.
end
journey->utils: invoke randomize function on\narray of journeys, please!
note over utils: randomize function randomly\nsorts an array by randomizing\nthe return value of the compare function.
utils->journey: Here is the randomized array of\nterrain the journey will go on.
journey->main: Here is the journey that this trip will take!
